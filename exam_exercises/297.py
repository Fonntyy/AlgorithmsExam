# Algo-X returns the sum of the k smallest values in A.
# If A contains less than k values, then the result is nil.
# The complexity is Î˜(n^2), since there are two nested loops
# that are run without shortcuts in the worst case of k > n.

# STRATEGY:
# It is easy enough to sort the array and then add up the first k elements.
# Or return nil if the length n of the array is less than k.
